h1. Bookmarklets 

This is one of the reasons I like Firefox. 

h2. Usage

# Copy the contents of the *cpan_shjs.js* javascript file.
# Open a CPAN source code page, like "this one":http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/DROLSKY/Moose-0.89/lib/Moose.pm.
# Paste the javascript code in the location bar of your browser. Hit intro.
# Voil√†. 
# Try clicking on package names to navigate the CPAN. 

If you like what you see, create a new bookmark and paste the code in the URL field. Than it's going to be as easy as pushing a button to highlight a CPAN source.

h2. cpan_shjs.js

This script is quite fast because it uses the lightweight "SHJS project":http://shjs.sourceforge.net/ .

Although it has no line numbering out of the box, it's doable.

h3. Customizing

You can theme it easily checking out this themes available here:

"":http://shjs.sourceforge.net/css/

h2. cpan_sh.js

This one uses "SyntaxHighlighter":http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter. It's quite lush, but maybe too busy for my taste buds. No package linking implemented, which requires developing a trigger of some sort. 

h2. Issues 

h3. Browsers

Developed and tested on Firefox 3.5. I ignore if the rest of the browsing world support this thing. Try it then let me know if it works.

h3. Hosting

The scripts are hosted on their authors pages. I recommend you change it to a local repository, maybe even your harddisk. Both for performance reasons or to avoiding 404 errors on repository changes.
